# Ticket Kanban Index

**As of 2026-11-02 · `aidev`**. This index includes the historical work and the Draw/Atlas separation documentation tasks introduced since [a9a3bc2](https://github.com/FivePebblesGPT/DrawInAtlas/commit/a9a3bc23d4c03b577d00526e1993f93cac1b121c).

**Canonical state:** ticket frontmatter (`status`, `manual_review`, `depends_on`). See [ticket workflow and closure gates](TICKET_WORKFLOW.md). **Done** on a pre-split ticket means its original acceptance was completed, *not* that the new Drawing application/Atlas integration exists. Web ticket T-044 is archived ([full historical ticket](Archive/Web/T-044.md)).

## Kanban summary

| Ready | In Progress | Blocked | Manual Review | Done | Archived | Total |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 21 | 1 | 11 | 3 | 40 | 1 | 77 |

**T-068 in progress (2026-11-02):** [controlled CPU and native-frame benchmark](DRAWING_CPU_RASTER_BENCHMARK.md) includes 691 Godot checks on the latest rerun, **10 native kernel unit tests**, 128 Godot/C++ alpha-parity vectors, a 24-pixel signed-world fixture, 15 sparse-delta-only C++ timings, and **68 native X11 software-frame checks** across 21 input events. A new ABI-versioned delta-only prototype avoids copying unchanged edit buffers but remains unintegrated. Tile-run compositing provides ~16× lower CPU-frame time on the bounded fixture. Actual Blend2D/Skia performance, GDExtension integration, physical presentation and Windows hardware remain unverified; **no native dependency was adopted and T-068 is not Done**.

**T-067 completed (2026-11-02):** [controlled 256/512/1024/2048 Zstd tile and 3-layout packing benchmark](DRAWING_CHUNK_GEOMETRY_BENCHMARK.md) includes 48 physical-layout cases, 386 Godot native checks, software framebuffer upload measurements and explicit retiling/versioning rules. **512** is recommended for a *future new-document default* and immutable shared **segmented** packs are the physical-layout target; **neither change has been deployed**. Existing versioned 256-stride documents and T-066’s verified individual-blob writer remain authoritative until separate adoption and atomic-recovery tests. No manual review gate was bypassed.

**T-066 completed (2026-11-02):** [portable generation-based sparse campaign saving](DRAWING_STORAGE_CONTRACT.md) now durably publishes the single Atlas root pointer after verifying checked manifests, compressed tiles, Object Assets, licensed fonts and recovery roots. The real editor saves and reopens Drawing documents. T-067 subsequently completed its geometry/packing benchmark; adoption of its recommended default/pack layout is separate work. T-056/T-059 owner UX gates remain open.

**T-055 completed (2026-11-02):** [Atlas canvas composition, linked Objects, input precedence and read-only previews](DRAWING_ATLAS_COMPOSITION.md) use the one canonical Drawing package with 89 headless and 13 native display checks. T-056 is now **Ready** for separate engineering/release/owner verification; its manual-review approval remains pending. T-066 subsequently implemented the versioned multi-file save.

**T-061 completed (2026-11-02):** [Atlas floor/detail Drawing registry and shared signed world mapping](DRAWING_WORLD_MAPPING.md) now prove per-detail stable IDs, sparse blank D-levels, explicit pixel densities, 64-bit viewport anchors, Object Instance detail scoping and grid/entrance overlay continuity. **T-055 subsequently completed** main-canvas composition. T-061 does not claim that composition or T-066’s multi-file atomic save.

**T-062 completed (2026-11-02):** the [shared dedicated Object Editor](Tickets/T-062.md) now uses the same Drawing workspace in standalone Drawing and an Atlas-hosted window, with private drafts, Save/Save As, captured instance identity, signed local frames, unsaved-close protection and real UI/registry/history tests. **T-064 is now Ready**; Atlas main-canvas launch/composition (T-055) subsequently completed; the Asset Browser (T-065) and owner UX review remain outstanding.

**Owner review is intentionally narrow.** `Owner` in the table marks a direct completion gate; `Via T-039` indicates inherited privacy-policy approval. Agents can research, implement and test pending dependencies, but **must not mark Done** until the relevant direct and transitive manual approvals are recorded. Approved Drawing feature scope does not mean the final UX is accepted.

**T-051 completed (2026-11-02):** [testable Drawing document/package ADR](ADR_DRAWING_DOCUMENT_CONTRACT.md) and signed-tile consumer. **T-052 completed (2026-11-02):** the [independent generic Drawing core](../addons/drawing/README.md) and an isolated Godot consumer with 150+ runtime checks. T-053 is now Done with an [independently runnable desktop Drawing project](../drawing/README.md), a portable standalone document witness, native framebuffer tests, a third generic consumer and Linux release export. T-058 is now Done with editable one-element text layers, a shared glyph compositor and explicit undoable rasterization; T-062 is now Done with a shared Object Editor and Atlas-bound Save As workflow. T-063 remains Ready. T-054 now provides tested Drawing-local and Atlas-global contextual history, one-step cross-document transfers and the Save As binding-history contract; subsequent Object Editor and Atlas canvas composition were delivered in T-062/T-055. T-060 now provides [versioned Object Assets, linked per-map instances, private Save drafts and atomic component-level Save As rebinding](../scripts/objects/README.md), including NULL placeholders and real portable-file tests. Its per-campaign object index is now captured by T-066’s portable generation snapshots. T-055 completes live Atlas composition; T-066 completes the versioned sparse campaign save. Polished UI, performance benchmarks and owner UX gates remain incomplete.

## Archived platform work

The Web-only [T-044 historical ticket](Archive/Web/T-044.md) is paused; native projector/privacy and collaboration tickets remain active. See [Web archive policy](Archive/Web/README.md).

## Maintaining this index

When adding or changing a ticket, keep its frontmatter and this table synchronized. Run `python3 tools/validate_ticket_store.py`; CI also checks these on repository updates. Never turn a manually gated ticket or any dependent ticket Done without the owner's explicit recorded approval.
